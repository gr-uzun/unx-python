    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    the computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;\n",
    "    the user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;\n",
    "    the first move belongs to the computer - it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;\n",
    "    all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)\n",
    "    the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;\n",
    "    the program checks if the game is over - there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, or the game ends with a tie, your win, or the computer's win;\n",
    "    the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;\n",
    "    don't implement any form of artificial intelligence - a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example session with the program may look as follows:\n",
