    "Once upon a time there was a land - a land of milk and honey, inhabited by happy and prosperous people. The people paid taxes, of course - their happiness had limits. The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was the so-called tax relief)\n",
    "if the income was higher than this amount, the tax was equal to 14,839 thalers and 2 cents, plus 32% of the surplus over 85,528 thalers.\n",
    "Your task is to write a tax calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should accept one floating-point value: the income.\n",
    "Next, it should print the calculated tax, rounded to full thalers. There's a function named round() which will do the rounding for you - you'll find it in the skeleton code in the editor.\n",
